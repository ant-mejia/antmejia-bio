        <p>Born and raised in the Empire City, I'm currently pursuing a career as a Front-End Web Developer. I've always had a passion for turning ideas into something that is functional, yet engaging; creating interactive and appealing web experiences. As I continue to improve my coding and design skills, my showcase will continue to grow while learning from every project I take on. Self taught and self motivated, I only have one opponent: Internet Explorer. In my spare time, you can find me shooting hoops, watching football, playing video games, and spending quality time with my family.</p>
